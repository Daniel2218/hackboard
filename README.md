# HackBoard

This repo is a basic prototype for a hackathon dashboard system. This dashboard will be an organizational tool for executives for a hackathon. One of the main aspects of this would be an application review system. This system would allow executive members of the hackathon to log in through a web portal and view all the applications. Not only can they view applicants but, they could accept, decline, or skip applicants. The system will be built using a rest api to allow for flexibility and customizability. Along with applications review system, the dashboard will include information about sponsors, prizes in the event, event information, scheduling information of the hackathon.

This project was abandon, and redesigned. You check the new version here: https://github.com/Daniel2218/react-hackboard
